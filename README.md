### User Stories

The goal of this game is guess who said a specific quote. Quotes will be divided into categories.
At the beginning of the game, the player will chose the category, game difficulty and number of quotes.
For each right answer, the player will gain points, while when the answer is wrong, they will lose points.

- User story 1: I want to prove myself how well I know a specific subject (movies, books, etc.).
- User story 2: I want to challenge my friends on who know a particular topic the best

### The Scope Plane

Users want to have fun playing a game that will challenge their knowledge on a subject of which they consider themselves experts.


### The Structure Plane

The website will have only one page. The content of the page will change base on the user's choices.
The first version of the page will have 4 questions:
- Name of the player
- Topic
- Number of questions
- Difficulty (this will impact the amount of options given to the user)

Once the user has filled in all these fields the game starts:
- The previous fields will disappear from the page
- On the page there will be one quote, 3/5 options based on the difficulty chosen, a progression bar and the current score.
- At the end, the page will have a congratulation message with the name of the user and the score.
